# About Me.
## My Interests
I enjoy writing fiction and poetry, building LEGO sets, and playing video games.
I have a published poetry book called [Desultory](https://a.co/d/9qZ6atx)!
My favorite LEGO set is the [UCS Millennium Falcon](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192). It was so fun to build!
My favorite video game is Life Is Strange. It was such a cool and unique experinece, and helped to shape who I am today.

## Websites I Recommend
- [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)
  Nexus Mods is an online platform for sharing video game modifications. This is my go-to website for finding mods for Skyrim, Starfield, Baldur's Gate, and more!

- [X](https://x.com/)
  X (formerly Twitter) is a great social media platform for self expression and connecting with diverse communites across the globe. Two things worth mentioning that set it apart from other social social media platforms are its protection of free speech, and its Community Notes feature, which helps fact-check misinformation on the platform.
